    <b>Incoming PhD at UMich in Fall 2024!! </b>
    <br> 
    <b>Thank you to everyone who supported and helped me during the application season!</b>

<p style="font-size:18px">
    I am a PhD candidate of Robotics Department at University of Michigan (<a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/" target="_blank">UMich</a>), where I work on legged robot control and learning with Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yanranding/home/" target="_blank">Yanran Ding</a>.
    Prior to that, I received my bachelor degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (<a href="https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/en" target="_blank">SUSTech</a>), majoring in Robotics Engineering. Advised by professor <a href="https://www.wzhanglab.site/members/" target="_blank">Wei Zhang</a>, I had a great research experience on MPC and RL of quadruped robots.
