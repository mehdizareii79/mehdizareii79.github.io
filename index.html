<h1>About Me</h1>

<p style="font-size:18px">
    I am a master student of <a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Robotics Department</a> at University of Michigan (UMich), where I work on legged robot control and learning with <a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/maani-ghaffari/" target="_blank">Maani Ghaffari</a> and previously on racecar autonomous racing.
    Prior to that, I received my bachelor degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), with a major in Robotics Engineering. Advised by <a href="https://www.wzhanglab.site/members/" target="_blank">Prof. Wei Zhang</a>, I had a great research experience working on MPC control and reinforcement learning (RL) of quadruped robots.

<p style="font-size:18px">
    I am broadly interested in robotics perception, planning and control, with a focus on developing efficient and deployable algorithms for legged robots.
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">
    Apart from my professional endeavors, I have a deep passion for competitive programming, robotics and enjoy tinkering with small DIY projects. When I'm not immersed in technology, you can find me swimming or in badminton court.
