<h1>About Me</h1>

<p style="font-size:18px; color:black">
    <b>I am actively seeking a PhD position in Fall 2024! </b>
    <br> 
    <b> Feel free to contact at</b> yulunz@umich.edu <b>if you are interested.</b>
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">
    I am a master student of <a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Robotics Department</a> at University of Michigan (UMich), where I work on legged robot control and learning with professor <a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/maani-ghaffari/" target="_blank">Maani Ghaffari</a> and previously on racecar autonomous racing.
    Prior to that, I received my bachelor degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), with a major in Robotics Engineering. Advised by professor <a href="https://www.wzhanglab.site/members/" target="_blank">Wei Zhang</a>, I had a great research experience working on MPC control and reinforcement learning (RL) of quadruped robots.

<!-- 
    I am broadly interested in robotics <b>perception, planning and control</b>, with a focus on developing efficient and deployable algorithms for <b>mobile robots</b>.
 -->
<p style="font-size:18px">
    I am strongly interested in agile legged locomotion in dynamic environments, with a focus on control and learning methods.
    Apart from my professional endeavors, I have a deep passion for competitive programming and tinkering small DIY projects. When I'm not immersed in technology, you can find me swimming or playing badminton.
