# About Me

I am a senior undergraduate from Southern University of Science and Technology, majoring in Robotics Engineering and advised by Prof. Wei Zhang.
I had a great research experience working in the wheeled-bipedal robot group of CLEAR Lab.

My research interests lie in Robot Perception and Autonomous Control, especially on vision aided dynamical system control using optimization and learning.
